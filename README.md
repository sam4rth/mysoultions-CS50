# mysoultions-CS50
***This is just to showcase my solutions for CS50 and I in no way promote any act of cheating from my code.***

I completed CS50x in 2020. And I will really recommend it to anyone who is just starting their journey in Computer Science, this well-structured course will help you learn the important parts of Computer Science! Even though they just scratch the surface of most of the topics it will add a lot of knowledge to your life with it, and it will make you clear what you have to learn and how... The best part is this course is not only about the lectures but also the practical applications of the knowledge. The challenging problem sets of every week will just test you till you really get the topic. The problem sets really take care of the part that there are no knowledge gaps and if they are there you will be forced to fill them. And I just love the Teachers and staffs of CS50! They are just the best at the work they are doing. It is really a high-class course and I am sure you will love it!!! ALL THE BEST!!!
